	<font size="+2"><p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Web design is a multi-disciplinary job, where you'd need not only knowledge in design (typography, color theory) but also skills in developing a website (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
		 Some web designers are also involved in interaction design when they code for animations and interactions using CSS and/or JavaScript.</p>
