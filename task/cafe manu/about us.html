        &nbsp;&nbsp;We are not only a place to drop in and get your morning cup of coffee (although you are more than welcome to do &nbsp;&nbsp;that), we are a place where you can sit down and enjoy that tailor-made cup of coffee.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;If you need to work, we have a seating area created specifically for you. If you need to rest, we have a 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;soft-&nbsp;&nbsp;seating area in front of a stone fire place that is perfect for your weary mind and body. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;We offer a delicious variety of coffee from Safehouse Coffee made by our professionally trained baristas. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;We have everything from classic coffee to our house made specialty beverages. <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;All of our sauces & syrups are made in-house with all natural ingredients (no chemicals or preservatives) &nbsp;&nbsp;ensuring you the highest quality in taste & health. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;You can complete your coffee with one of our delicious sweet treats made by our very own baker.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; We look forward to serving you at Taste & See Coffee Shop and Gallery!</p></div>
